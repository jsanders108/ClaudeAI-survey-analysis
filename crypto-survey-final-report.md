# Comprehensive Cryptocurrency Survey Report

## Introduction and Methodology

In late 2022, a survey was conducted to gauge public sentiment towards cryptocurrencies following a tumultuous year in the industry. The study aimed to explore awareness, ownership, attitudes, and future intentions regarding cryptocurrencies among the general population in the United States.

The survey, consisting of 18 questions, was distributed to a random sample of QuestionPro Audience panel members from December 22-28, 2022. A total of 150 completed responses were collected. 

## Executive Summary

This survey reveals significant insights into public perceptions and behaviors regarding cryptocurrencies:

1. **High Awareness, Varied Familiarity**: While 85% of respondents have heard of cryptocurrencies, only 27% consider themselves extremely or very familiar with them.

2. **Mixed Opinions**: Opinions are divided, with 24% viewing cryptocurrencies favorably, 30% unfavorably, and 46% neutral.

3. **Limited but Growing Ownership**: 18% of respondents currently own cryptocurrency, with an additional 31% likely to purchase in the future.

4. **Demographic Influences**: Age, education, income, and computer skills significantly impact all aspects of cryptocurrency perceptions and behaviors:
   - Younger, more educated, higher-income individuals with better computer skills consistently show higher awareness, familiarity, favorable opinions, ownership, and purchase intentions.
   - Older individuals, those with lower incomes, and those less comfortable with technology show lower engagement across all measures.

5. **Future Outlook**: While current adoption is modest, there's potential for growth, particularly among younger and more tech-savvy demographics.

These findings suggest a need for targeted education and communication strategies to address diverse perspectives and potentially increase adoption among less engaged demographics.

## Conclusion

This survey reveals a high level of awareness (85%) but varying degrees of familiarity with cryptocurrencies among the U.S. population. While a significant portion of respondents (46%) remain neutral about cryptocurrencies, there's a notable divide between those who view them favorably (24%) and unfavorably (30%). Current ownership levels are modest at 18%, but there's potential for growth, with 31% of respondents expressing likelihood to purchase in the future.

Demographic factors, particularly age, income, education, and computer skills, play a significant role in shaping awareness, familiarity, opinions, and intentions regarding cryptocurrencies. Younger respondents, those with higher income and education levels, and those with better computer skills consistently showed higher levels of awareness, familiarity, favorable opinions, current ownership, and future purchase intentions.

These findings provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the cryptocurrency industry and policymakers alike, highlighting the need for targeted education and communication strategies to address the diverse perspectives within the population. There's a clear opportunity to increase understanding and potential adoption among older individuals, those with lower incomes, and those less comfortable with technology.
